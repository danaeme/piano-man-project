# <PianoMan>
Piano-Man is a music-themed take on the "Simon" game: 
The player will need to match an increasing sequence of notes played by the computer opponent each round. Win 5 rounds to complete the game. If the notes are played incorrectly the computer will reset its sequence to 1 note.

- Checkpoint system, set progress every 5-10 rounds. 
- Styling to aking it more 'musical' - a 4/4 metronome, visually improving the keyboard to add black keys.
